				<h1>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics(STEM)</h1><br><br>
				<p>STEM is an educational program designed to prepare primary and secondary learners in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) for college and graduate education. STEM seeks to promote inquiring minds, logical reasoning, and collaborative abilities in relation to subject-specific teaching. In addition, STEM focuses on perceived education quality shortcomings in these fields, with the aim of increasing the supply of qualified high-tech workers.</p><br><br>
				<p>This strand will also develop the studentsâ€™ ability to evaluate simple to complex societal problems and be responsive and active in the formulation of its solution through the application and integration of scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical concepts as it prepares them to pursue college degrees that focuses on the enigma of the natural world thereby leading them to become future scientists, technological analysts and experts, engineers, mathematicians, programmers, and the like.</p>

				<h1>Benefits of STEM Education</h1>
				<div class="benefitsCard-stem">
					<h2>Fosters ingenuity and creativity:</h2><br>
					<p>Ingenuity and creativity can be combined with STEM, leading to fresh concepts and innovations. Without ingenuity and creativity, it would not be feasible to see latest advances in artificial intelligence or digital learning. These technologies were created by people who learned that if it could be conceived by the human mind, it could be achieved by the human mind. They certainly had an excellent teacher of K-12 STEM education.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="benefitsCard-stem">
					<h2>Builds Resilience:</h2><br>
					<p>Students learn in a secure setting during STEM education operations that enables them to drop back and attempt again. STEM education emphasizes the importance of failure as a learning practice that allows learners to take on errors as part of the learning cycle. This enables learners to create trust and resilience, enabling them to maintain going when it gets rough.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="benefitsCard-stem">
					<h2>Encourages experimentation:</h2><br>
					<p>Without a little risk-taking and experimentation, it would not be feasible to make many of the technological advances that have taken place in the last few centuries. Many of these technologies have been developed by individuals who have been told that their thoughts will not work and their reaction has been, "Let's try and see." This type of attitude can be encouraged with STEM learning during the K-12 years. How can you accomplish this? By allowing students to experiment and take risks during learning activities.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="benefitsCard-stem">
					<h2>Encourages teamwork:</h2><br>
					<p>Students of all skill levels can be taught STEM education. Students with variable skill levels can work together in teams to discover issues alternatives, record information, write reports, offer presentations, etc. Students who know how to work with others and flourish in a team-oriented setting are the end product.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="benefitsCard-stem">
					<h2>Encourages knowledge application:</h2><br>
					<p>Students are taught abilities in STEM education which they can use in the actual globe. This motivates learners to learn because they understand that they can use the abilities they obtain instantly and in ways that have a positive effect on them and their loved ones. When they join the workforce, the capacity to apply their understanding to fresh and new assignments will bode well for them.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="benefitsCard-stem">
					<h2>Encourages tech use:</h2><br>
					<p>It teaches kids about the power of technology and innovation. So, when students encounter new technologies, they will be prepared to embrace them, instead of being hesitant or fearful. This will give them the upper hand in the global landscape, as the world is becoming increasingly tech-centered.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="benefitsCard-stem">
					<h2>Teaches problem-solving:</h2><br>
					<p>It teaches students how to solve problems by using their critical thinking skills. By engaging in STEM learn experiences, students learn how to examine problems and then create a plan to solve them.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="benefitsCard-stem">
					<h2>Encourages adaption:</h2><br>
					<p>To succeed in life, students have to be able to apply what they have learned to a variety of scenarios. STEM education teaches them to adapt the concepts that they learn to various iterations of a problem or issue.</p>
